However, few practitioners realize that sage isn’t the only thing you can burn to dispel negative energy from your life without having to confront your underlying issues. There are plenty of everyday, flammable items that provide the same stress-reducing, mood-boosting perks. The best part? If you’re a self-care fanatic like me, you probably already have most of these things lying around the house!</p>\n\n<h3>Parsley, Rosemary, or Thyme</h3>\n<p>Other fresh herbs can be subbed for sage in a pinch. However, be sure to tie the branches with a whimsical piece of twine before burning. If your DIY smudge stick doesn’t look like it could retail at Anthropologie for $19.99, it will be completely ineffective at purifying your surroundings.</p>\n\n<h3>Young Adult Novels</h3>\nClear out old energy from your space by setting the regrettable relics of your teen years on fire. In my experience, books that romanticize toxic relationships are especially long-burning. The four-part Twilight saga, for example, clocks in at over 500 pages per book and could easily get you through months of sage-free ritual cleansings. Proceed with caution, though – these novels are quick to heat up given that they’re mostly hot air.\n\n<h3>Wedding Invitations</h3>\n<p>High-quality cardstock declaring two people’s lifelong commitment to each other is one of the most purifying materials you can ignite. Although not technically anti-microbial, charred wedding invites can clear away reminders of pathogens like my disease of an ex. Of course he wasn’t ready for anything serious during the years we were together, but then went on to propose to his new girlfriend within months! Of course! This is also a great way to declutter!</p>\n\n<h3>Jury Summons</h3>\n<p>Showing up for jury duty is NOT self-care. Next time you receive a jury summons letter in the mail, try setting it ablaze. You’ll be shocked at how quickly the dark clouds of dread hanging over you will dissipate. Burning jury summons is an extremely effective way to reduce stress and anxiety, like the kind you feel when you wait for hours in a hot, crowded courtroom. Not today, Southern District of New York. Not today.</p>\n\n<h3>Peyote</h3>\n<p>Mildy psychoactive, sage has long been used by healers to enhance intuition and spirituality. When sage is scarce, I light up some of my leftover peyote from Burning Man to experience all the same, wonderful hallucinogenic benefits. Just FYI: the psychoactives in peyote might be a little bit stronger.</p>\n\n<h3>Effigies</h3>\n<p>You’ve probably avoided engulfing your voodoo dolls in flames before now. Apprehensive over the havoc you might wreak upon the people your dolls represent? I was, too – until I tried it. Rest assured that there were no unfortunate consequences for my ex and his fiancee after any of my effigy-scorching sessions. Their relationship is “stronger than ever.” Can’t wait for their wedding in September! Oh, and burning effigies is a big mood lifter, or whatever.</p>\n\n<h3>IRS Audit Notifications</h3>\n<p>Just as you’d set your intention before smudging, it’s essential to declare your goals when blazing up audit notifications from the Internal Revenue Service: tax evasion, tax evasion, tax evasion! Burning any and all communications from the IRS helps banish negative thoughts about the possibility of paying income taxes. If I can’t file jointly, I won't file at all. Remember: nothing is illegal if you do it in the name of self-care. This upcycled sage substitute helps you avoid paying sales tax on $19.99 Anthropologie smudge sticks, too!</p>\n\n<h3>Restraining Orders</h3>\n<p>You might be tempted to carefully preserve any paperwork you receive after being served with a restraining order from a lowlife like my ex. After all, it may well be the only legal document you’ll own that bears his name. However, I highly recommend letting your restraining orders smolder to ash and pretending like you didn’t receive anything, instead. I never feel more serene or energized than when I watch flames consume court orders imbued with bad, bad energy. Good vibes only!!</p>\n\n            </div>\n        )\n}\n\nexport default Sage","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport Navbar from './components/Navbar'\nimport { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Home from './components/Home'\nimport Contact from './components/Contact'\nimport Writing from './components/Writing'\nimport Sage from './components/Sage'\n\nclass App extends Component {\n    render() {\n    return (\n      <BrowserRouter>\n        <div className=\"App\">\n          <Navbar / >\n          <Route exact path = '/' component = { Home } />\n          <Route path = '/writing' component = { Writing } />\n          <Route path = '/contact' component = { Contact } />\n          <Route path = '/week3assignment' component = { Sage } />\n        </div>\n      </BrowserRouter>\n    );\n    }\n  }\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
